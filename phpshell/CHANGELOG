2005-12-27  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php:
	Added code to prevent simple replay attacks by only accepting each
	login form once.
	
2005-12-25  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* INSTALL: Information about the new internal configuration.
	
	* phpshell.php: Made authentication internal.

	* SECURITY: New file.

	* config.php: New file.

	* style.css: New file.  Renamed from phpshell.css.

2004-03-27  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.29: Removed debug output.

	* README 1.11: Updated documentation for new cool shell-like interface.

	* INSTALL 1.5:
	Updated documentation about the command substitution using alises.

	* phpshell.css 1.2:
	New styles to make the textarea and input box blend together.

	* phpshell.php 1.28: A little documentation for the alias feature.

	* phpshell.php 1.27:
	The shell now looks and behaves much more like a real shell: the shell
	now has a commandline history just like a real shell.

	The parsing of 'cd' commands have been rewritten so that even more
	special cases are taken care of, and simple command substitution using
	aliases have been introduced.

2004-03-24  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.26:
	Increased year of copyright to 2004.  Fixed the references to the PNG
	images, as pointed out by Michael Z. Bell.

2003-11-11  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* AUTHORS 1.6:
	Added Wolfgang Dautermann <wolfgang.dautermann@fh-joanneum.at>.

	* phpshell.php 1.25:
	Ups, I commited with $passwd = array('foo' => 'bar').

	* phpshell.php 1.24:
	Wolfgang Dautermann <wolfgang.dautermann@fh-joanneum.at> suggested
	that the directory list should be sorted.

	Also, changing directory through symbolic links now works as expected,
	so that it's possible to go back using 'cd ..'.

	* INSTALL 1.4:

	* phpshell.php 1.23:
	Updated to use XHTML 1.0 Strict and the $_* variables in PHP
	4.1.0. This effectively breaks compatibility with earlier versions of
	PHP. If you cannot upgrade your PHP installation (you really should
	consider upgrading to get hold of the latest security and bug fixes)
	when just use PhpShell version 1.7 --- there's no new functionality in
	this release.

	* README 1.6: Told people about the rewriting of 'ls' into 'ls -F'

	* phpshell.php 1.12:
	You can now travel through the filesystem by using the normal 'cd'
	command. If your command involves 'cd', it will be intercepted and the
	current working directory will be changed accordingly.

	* README 1.5: Updated the documentation a bit.

2001-02-11  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.11:
	Another suggestion from Thomas Langen <langen@langensoft.de>: some
	people can't use the .php extension, so now the script uses $PHP_SELF
	instead.

	* phpshell.php 1.10:
	Expanded all PHP start-tags (<?) to <?php, as suggested by Thomas
	Langen <langen@langensoft.de>.

	Added a link to gimpster.com at the bottom of the page

2000-08-05  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.5:

	just a '.php'

2000-06-21  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>
